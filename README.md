The "Smart Ambulance Warner" project is an innovative solution aimed at reducing delays in emergency medical services. The system utilizes an ultrasonic sensor to detect an approaching ambulance within a 1 km range. Once detected, it communicates with the traffic signal system to automatically turn the light green in the ambulance's direction, ensuring a clear path. 

**Key Features:**
- **Ultrasonic Sensor Integration**: Detects vehicles within a specified range.
- **Signal Automation**: Adjusts traffic lights dynamically to prioritize ambulance movement.
- **Real-Time Communication**: Ensures immediate action upon detection, minimizing human intervention.
- **Scalability**: Can be integrated into smart city infrastructure for wider implementation.

This project could involve microcontrollers like Arduino or Raspberry Pi for processing, wireless communication modules for data transmission, and possibly GPS for enhanced ambulance tracking.
